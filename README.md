# Anomaly-Detection-for-System-Generated-Logs
The goal of this project is to solve the problem of processing logs causing excessive system load and anomalous behavior. The goals of this research are to better understand user behavior, allocate resources efficiently, and improve organizational decision-making procedures. We examine the dataset and gain important insights by using cutting-edge data analysis techniques and predictive models including Random Forest, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting Model, and Isolation Forest model. The findings of this study provide the sponsor company with practical suggestions for enhancing operational effectiveness and boosting performance. We seek to deliver actionable insights and recommendations to improve the company's understanding of user behavior and optimize resource allocation processes through thorough data validation and analysis.

Recommendations:
Based on the analysis of feature importance, it is recommended to focus on the two features that have been identified as the most important: 'HTTP.Method' and 'HTTP.Auth'.
1. Utilize the 'HTTP.Method' Information: DocDigitizer should leverage the insights gained from analyzing the 'HTTP.Method' feature to optimize their resource allocation and improve their platform's performance. By understanding the distribution and patterns of different HTTP methods used by their users, they can allocate appropriate resources to handle the processing load efficiently. For example, if a significant portion of requests are made using the POST method, indicating document submissions, DocDigitizer can ensure they have sufficient processing capacity to handle these requests in a timely manner. Additionally, monitoring for any unexpected or unauthorized HTTP methods, such as HEAD, can help identify and prevent potential security threats or misuse of the platform.

2. Strengthen API Key Security: As observed from the analysis of the 'HTTP.Auth' feature, DocDigitizer should prioritize the security of their API keys. They should implement robust security measures, such as strong encryption and secure storage, to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the API keys. Regular monitoring of API key usage and detection of any anomalies, such as multiple requests with different keys from the same IP address, should be conducted to identify potential security breaches or unauthorized access attempts in this case is “Unknown”. DocDigitizer should promptly investigate and take appropriate actions to mitigate these risks, such as blocking suspicious IP addresses and notifying users to update their API keys.
